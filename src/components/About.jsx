              Welcome! I am a Full Stack Developer with a background in the
              military, where I developed key skills in precision, strategy, and
              adaptability. These qualities have been pivotal in my approach to
              coding and problem-solving, enabling me to deliver innovative tech
              solutions with discipline and efficiency. My experience has
              fostered a strong work ethic and leadership abilities, which I
              leverage to drive projects forward and overcome complex
              challenges. Beyond coding, I engage in music production and
              fitness, activities that underscore my commitment to continuous
              personal and professional growth. I seek opportunities with
              dynamic teams where I can contribute my problem-solving skills and
              positive mindset to transform challenges into successes. Let's
              connect and explore how we can create impactful solutions
              together.
